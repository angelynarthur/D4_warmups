Write a sql query to create a histogram of number of comments per user in the month of January 2019.


SELECT user_comments.created_at, count(user_comments.created_at)
FROM users INNER JOIN user_comments ON users.id = user_comments.user_id
WHERE user_comments.created_at BETWEEN  ‘2019-01-01’ AND ‘2019-01-31’
GROUP BY user_comments.created_at, user_comments.user_id;


SELECT created_at, count(created_at)
FROM user_comments
WHERE user_comments.created_at BETWEEN  ‘2019-01-01’ AND ‘2019-01-31’
GROUP BY created_at;

—no comments query

WITH zero_count AS (Select created_at, count(created_at) as total_count
FROM user_comments
WHERE user_comments.created_at BETWEEN  ‘2019-01-01’ AND ‘2019-01-31’ 
GROUP BY created_at)

SELECT * FROM zero_count HAVING total_count = 0;



--Some code I used to test from the northwind db

SELECT orders.order_date, count(orders.order_date)
FROM orders 
GROUP BY orders.order_date;

SELECT orders.order_date, count(orders.order_date)
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date = '1996-09-09'
GROUP BY orders.order_date;
